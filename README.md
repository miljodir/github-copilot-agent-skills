## Agents

| Agent | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `apim-policy-author` | APIM Policy Author — generates production-ready Azure API Management policy XML for authentication, rate limiting, CORS, error handling, and transformations with hybrid auth best practices |
| `azure-architect` | Azure Solutions Architect — designs production-ready architectures aligned to WAF and CAF |
| `gh-aw-builder` | GitHub Agentic Workflow Builder — creates and configures markdown-based AI-powered GitHub Agentic Workflows (gh-aw) with proper frontmatter, MCP servers, safe-outputs, and best practices |
| `terraform-provider-upgrade` | Terraform Provider Upgrade — safely upgrades Terraform providers, detects breaking changes, migrates removed resources with moved blocks, and ensures compatibility through comprehensive upgrade workflows |

## Usage

1. Clone or fork this repository.
2. Open in VS Code with GitHub Copilot Chat enabled.
3. Reference an agent via `@azure-architect` or invoke a skill by asking Copilot to use it by name.
4. Skills are loaded automatically when referenced in `copilot-instructions.md` or triggered by relevant queries.

## Contributing

New agents and skills are added on an ongoing basis. Each skill lives in its own directory under `.github/skills/` and follows a consistent `SKILL.md` structure defining its purpose, inputs, and output format.
